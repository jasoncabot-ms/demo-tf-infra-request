# Demo - Infrastructure Request using Terraform
A demo project to show how you can use GitHub Actions to fulfill infrastructure provisioning requests with Terraform

## Summary

We want to maintain a process that allows people to provision a known-good set of infrastructure in Azure. There should be a log of who deployed what, why and when, with central controls and governance on exactly what it is that get deployed.

There should be sharing or exposing of credentials anywhere in the process.
